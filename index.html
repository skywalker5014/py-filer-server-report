            <p>
                The backend application server is built using the FastAPI web framework integrated with the uvicorn ASGI server.
                The backend follows a modular monolithic architectural approach with two processes parallely while sharing the same 
                resources or dependencies since the project is integrated with the monorepo style structure. 
                <br>
                The main components of the backend server are: 
                <ul>
                    <li>FastAPI/uvicorn application to handle user interaction</li>
                    <li>Python schedular/CRON job process to handle automated database manipulation</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    FastAPI/uvicorn application: <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            This process handles the direct user requests from the frontend interface using API endpoints defined by
                            FastAPI web framework.                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            there are five services or API's provided for the user to interact with: <br>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    user management / authentication API: <br>
                                    users can register and login with the application. User authentication is handled using token
                                    based stateless authentication using the JWT standard. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    file upload API: <br>
                                    users can upload a raw file or blobs into the server by setting an expiry duration. The backend 
                                    will handle the automatic deletion of the file uploaded on reaching expiry defined by the user.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    uploads view API: <br>
                                    users can see all of their files they have uploaded (both expired and not expired ones)
                                    and see all of those files that are uploaded by others which are not yet expired. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    download API: <br>
                                    users can download any files that are not yet expired. They can choose to download their own
                                    files or even those not expired files uploaded by other users using a unique code provided by the server. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    delete API: <br>
                                    users can manually delete their files from the server that they have uploaded before expiry using 
                                    the unique code provided by the server to the specific file. 
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Schedular/CRON process: <br>
                        this process automatically scans the database every fixed interval to automatically handle the deletion of the
                        uploaded files from all the users from the server upon reaching the provided expiry time. 
                        This process only deletes actual raw file from the server while soft deleting the actual metadata of the deleted or 
                        expired file.

                    <div>
                        this table holds every records of all the files uploaded by every user. This table is related with the user table 
                        using the email field as foreign key. This table has fields email, filename, expire time, unique code for the file, 
                        expiry status. The email is used to know which user is linked to the management of the specific file with the name
                        stored in the filename. The expiry status is of type boolean, it is used to check the expiry status of the file, 
                        if it is expired (true) or not (false).

                Docker setup: <br>
                this project is containerized using docker. Two containers are created to run the project. One for the backend application server
                and another for the postgresql database system. <br>
                    here are the step by step containerization method: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>creating the image of backend application server using <br> <br><b class="cli">$ docker build -t py_server_image . </b><br> <br>command while in root dir of project with Dockerfile.</li>
                        <li>creating a custom network inside docker to connect all containers: <br> <br>
                        <b class="cli">$ docker network create myNet</b> <br> <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            creating a volume block to persist data: <br> <br>
                            <b class="cli">$ docker volume create myVolume</b> <br> <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>creating and running containers of the backend server and database server from their images: <br>

                                                here the postgres database container is created using the official postgresql docker image as base and 
                                                this container is named "psql". psql is connected to the myNet custom docker bridge network and all its data
                                                is dumped into the myVolume storage block for data persistency.

                                                All the environment variable is passed to the server container and is also connected to the myNet docker bridge 
                                                network. Since docker does not run in the same timezone of the host,
                                                an extra docker specific timezone environment variable "TZ" is also passed to sync the timezone with the host 
                                                for our cron process to run properly. This server container runs on the dockers's internal virtual tcp port 8000
                                                and it is mapped to the hosts tcp port 8000 so the frontend can have access to it from the outside.
